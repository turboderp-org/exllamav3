    dynamic mmap threshold moves them into the heap after the first free, and what malloc_trim can
    then hand back depends on the allocator and the platform). Buffers are handed out by exact shape
    and dtype, returned on eviction, and never freed, so the pool's footprint is bounded by the peak
    checkpoint occupancy and the allocator sees no churn at all.
